### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**pottsie283/pottsie283** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I'm not currently working on any projects, though having got a keen interest in GitHub, and expanding my technological boundaries further - I'm sure this will be a key tool in helping me to do just that.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently studying an Integrated Master of Computer Science at Birmingham City University in Birmingham, United Kingdom. I'm predominantly entertaining an idea of a career within the Cyber Security field within this subject, though I have fond interests within Data Science, and Programming. I have past experience in Python, C++, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript - and little fondles with the likes of F# and C#.
- ğŸ‘¯ Anything!! Anything that peaks my interest, I'd like to have a say about.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with... i'm not sure.. i'll get stuck on something inevitably.
- ğŸ’¬ Getting started with Python, very straightforward - I've had 4/5 years expereience of the language.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a homebrewed Wii U and a Hackintosh - who pays for an iMac like seriously?

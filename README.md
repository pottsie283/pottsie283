### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm still very new to GitHub, though i'm very excited to work on new projects - and whenever I have the time (this degree takes a LOT of my time :/), I might try to create some of my own.
A little bit about me:
ðŸ”­ I'm not currently working on any projects, though having got a keen interest in GitHub, and expanding my technological boundaries further - I'm sure this will be a key tool in helping me to do just that.
ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying an Integrated Master of Computer Science at Birmingham City University in Birmingham, United Kingdom. I'm predominantly entertaining an idea of a career within the Cyber Security field within this subject, though I have fond interests within Data Science, and Programming. I have past experience in Python, C++, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript - and little fondles with the likes of F# and C#.
ðŸ‘¯ Anything!! Anything that peaks my interest, I'd like to have a say about.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with... i'm not sure.. i'll get stuck on something inevitably.
ðŸ’¬ Getting started with Python, very straightforward - I've had 4/5 years expereience of the language.
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
âš¡ Fun fact: I have a homebrewed Wii U, and I have modded Wii's and 3DS consoles in the past. I often play on either PC, Switch (bummed I can't mod) or Xbox One X (don't have the money to upgrade yet LOL). I have also Hackintosh'd my PC in the past, but only then it made me realise how good Windows is - so I quickly moved back :)

...I should probably dual boot Linux....
